# welcome to my notes!

Hi! I'm Neha Desaraju.

These are my Evergreen-like notes in a Zettelkasten-like system, because I want to think better share my journey. I was hugely inspired by [Andy Matuschak's](https://notes.andymatuschak.org) and [Nikita Voloboev's](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz) versions of the same thing. This website was built on Jekyll and Netlify, thanks to [Max Vaillancourt's template](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template).

There's no index, but I'm sure you'll find a node graph of some sorts if you snoop around some more ;)

My [DMs are open on Twitter (@nehadesaraju)](https://twitter.com/nehadesaraju). Say hi! ðŸ‘‹

  Why don't you start with <span style="font-weight: bold">[[Learning must be deliberately holistic]]</span> to get started on your exploration?
