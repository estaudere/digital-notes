ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Neha Desaraju, a student based in Dallas, TX. I see you've stumbled across my notes!

I do other things too, like writing, reporting, editing, communications, data viz, machien learning, politics, and organizing. I'm finding more and more that I don't need to squeeze myself into one thing I "love," like we're taught to do. Still working out the logistics!

You can find me across the interwebs, but I'm on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nehadesaraju) and [Github](https://github.com/estaudere) the most. My other work can be found on my [portfolio](https://estaudere.github.io).

Thank you for joining me on this journey!
