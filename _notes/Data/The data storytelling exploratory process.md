There are four questions to ask yourself when you get some data:

**What data do you have?** Your mindset should be data first, visualization later. This is often the most time-consuming process, but make sure you have the write data for what you are trying to explore.

**What do you want to know about your data?** This is probably the most overwhelming part, but start with a couple questions that are easy to answer, then go big. The more specific you are with your questions the most direction you will get and the easier your life will be.

**What visualization methods should you use?** During early stages it is more important to see your data from different angles than choosing the right visualization. This should come after! (When you're ready for this, refer to [[Parts of a visualization]].)

**What do you see and does it make sense?**
Keywords: increasing, decreasing, some mix, outliers, how much change there is and how prominent the patterns are.

The key is to jump between these questions a lot throughout the exploration of your dataset!
