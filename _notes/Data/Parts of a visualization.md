Visualization is simply mapping data to geometry and color, the way the mind naturally imagines data.

**Visualization components:**
- Position: compare values based on where others are places in a given space or coordinate system
- Length: how long the shapes are
- Angle: rotation between vectors
- Direction: slope of a vector in space
- Shapes: symbols as categories
- Area: how much 2D space
- Volume: how much 3D space
- Color saturation: intensity of a color hue
- Color hue: also known as just color

There are also different types of scales: linear, logarithmic, categorical, ordinal, percent, and time.

You can use any combination of these, whichever is most intuitive for the story you are trying to tell, and what is easy to map to your data.

Note that the "best" components to use are not always the ones that are the most intriguing or draw something out of the reader.
