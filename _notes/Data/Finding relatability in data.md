The main purpose of data storytelling is, arguably, to make the data mean something to a reader. It sets the data and vizualizations up in a way that, by the end, the reader can't ignore what they see.

Data storytelling does this in a number of ways. First, it's probably aesthetically pleasing. It also does not need to go into all parts of the data, and the data itself does not need to be statistically conclusive. It's only there to illustrate something for the reader.

Most importantly, it needs to find relatabillity. A statistical report will rarely find some sort of connection with the readerâ€”that's not its purpose. Its only purpose is to communicate information.

A data story, on the other hand, needs to point out that the data means something to them. A vizualization about life expectancy, for example, can ask the reader to input their age and gender and tell the reader how long they are expected to live. A story surrounding a particular map can begin with an anecdote about one data point in one location.
