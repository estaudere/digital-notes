## Notes can help you write better

Aside from the connectivity abilities of taking notes ([[Learning must be deliberately holistic]]), I am also aiming to become a clearer thinker by creating densely connected notes. In addition to seeing deeper connections, I want to articulate them.

This is backed well by the property of my notes being atomic (see: [[Elaborating on atomicity]]); meaning, they only articulate one thought. Focusing on just one idea helps to clarify it.

Most people write notes passively, as a form of (potentially) remembering information. This is fine, but does not lead to better writing or clearer thinking. Instead, Evergreen or Zettelkasten notes should be written as a form of mini-essay, or a chunk of an argument. This is practice for better #writing.
