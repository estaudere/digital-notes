- data is not an absolute truth, it's an educated guess (use data that does not have large levels of uncertainty attached)
- variablity may vary depending on level of granularity
- you need context for data, or it is useless
	- who (who the data is coming from)
	- how (don't skip the methodology)
	- what (what is the data about)
	- when (linked to time)
	- where (avoid global generatlizations, data can vary across cities/states/countries)
	- why (why was the data collected, check for bias)
- visualization components
	- simply mapping data to geometry + color
	- position: compare values based on where others are places in a given space or coordinate system
	- length: how long the shapes are
	- angle: rotation between vectors
	- direction: slope of a vector in space
	- shapes: symbols as categories
	- area: how much 2d space
	- volume: how much 3d space
	- color saturation: intensity of a color hue
	- color hue/color
- viz scales: linear, logarithmic, categorical, ordinal, percent, time

- exploratory process
	- What data do you have?
		- data first viz later
		- often the most time consuming process
	- What do you want to know about your data?
		- early exploration of a dataset can be overwhelming, but ask qs about the data and let your curiosities guide you
		- the more specific with your questions you are the most direction you get
	- What visualization methods should you use?
		- during early stages it's more important to see your data from different angles & drilling down what matters than choosing the right viz
	- What do you see and does it make sense?
		- increasing, decreasing, outliers, some mix, how much change is there + how prominent the patterns are
	- Jump around between these questions a lot
