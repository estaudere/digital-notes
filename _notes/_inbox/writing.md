## #writing a YA Novel
Great dialogue gives your story "texture of lived life." It propels plot (what/get/do). Tool for showing/building/resolving conflict between characters
No info dump!
It's an exciting, eavesdropping quality

- avoiding info dumps
	- Rewrite as arguments
	- Comparative convo (to "check notes")
	- One character oblivious
	- Expository narration

- great characters: attach one or even more! of these three
	- dimension: layered with internal paradoxes, flaws and failures
	- conflict: internal/external
	- empathy: most powerful when attached to villains

**subtext in dialogue**
- "special halo" around dialogue that communicates what is not written
- build up to future plot reveals
- reveal character's feelings and occupations
- lead to a *further revelation*

**outlining characters**
- bubble method to illustrate relationships
- Q&A/interview questions
- stream of consciousness (fragments of whatever comes to mind)
- have some questions in mind:
	-  What is their family dynamic? (How many members, how do they interact, etc.)
	-   Was their childhood happy or troubled?
	-   Where did they grow up?Â 
	-   Were they rich, poor, middle class?
	-   Who are their friends and how did they meet?
	-   Were there any traumas in their lives?
	-   What are some of their happiest memories? Worst memories?
	-   Why did they choose their career?
	-   How many romantic relationships have they had? Were they good or bad? Why did they end?
	-   What is one thing they would wish to change about the past?

*Note: Conflict-based dialogue comes first! Otherwise, don't include it*

- People are bundles of conflict

**more dialogue**
- Voice can reveal personality, current mood/psychological state, background, key differences between them and other characters (which builds attraction or repulsion)
- Dialogue is easier to read than paragraphs of narration, and cut meaningless fluff down
	- condense when it should be tense, limit dialogue tags

Think about character description: you need something that imprints in the readers' minds, and it doesn't have to be basic characteristics. (Think: "vulture-eye" in *The Tell-Tale Heart*, when the man is never described but you remember him clearly.) Think about behavior/mannerisms, symbolism (which makes writing it very fun), make them distinguishable from each other.
