## The process
 
There are two types of notes that come from a piece of content:
- Fleeting notes, which are temporary reminders of ideas
- and literature notes, which come from fleeting notes you really want to keep

Fleeting notes most often take the form of daily notes, which gives them the least amount of structure possible (it is important to take care not to prematurely name or categorize these notes). Simple bullet points is fine. Do not take notes on everything—just the sentences you want to keep. You'll delete them later.

Literature notes [[Elaborating on atomicity|grow]] from these fleeting notes. The topics emerge as diamonds in the rough—the topics that you are truly interested to explore, and may be the thing(s) you take away the most from the content. This is where [[The Feynman Technique for developing insight]] builds insight.
