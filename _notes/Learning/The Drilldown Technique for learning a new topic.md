There are three steps to learning pretty much everything—that is, developing deep understanding in any topic so that it sticks.

1. Coverage
2. Practice
3. Insight

Coverage comes from an *incredibly* high-level overview. This is where you watch the lecture on 2x speed, read the book front to back, or skim the textbook chapter. No notes. None. In fact, I would limit notes to thorough [[Use notes to become a better writer|concept notes]] to help you figure out where the new concept fits into your brain map. It encourages you to get better at things you already know and connect new topics to ideas.

For application concepts, most people understand that you need practice, practice, practice. However, in order for this to be effective, you need *instant feedback*. 

Lastly, insight is by far the hardest step, because what it takes to get there develops a lot of thinking—and the path is pretty nebulous too. Here are some recommendations:

- Use [[The Feynman Technique for developing insight]] at the end of every big idea to identify gaps in your knowledge.
- Break those gaps into chunks, filling them up with more knowledge.
- Connect these ideas to your brain map (see: [[Elaborating on atomicity]]).
