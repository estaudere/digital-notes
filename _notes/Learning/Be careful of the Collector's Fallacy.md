In the age of the internet, the Collector's Fallacy consumes us.

With all this knowledge at our fingertips, it feels like we either a) are productive or b) know everything, when neither are usually the case. In truth, the ability to simply save links to information and do nothing with it (and *feel like* we're doing something with it) limits us. It's an illusion of competence.

I'm guilty of it too. I often feel like I have just learned something knew when I save a link in a file I will probably never see again. That's why I created this wiki systemâ€”because I felt as though I consumed a lot of content but never applied it anywhere.

In order to fight this, I am trying to be more mindful of the content I consume and what I do with it. These notes help me because I'm putting thoughts into a system and forming connections with it visually, instead of just in my head (where it's likely to never be seen again).

I do keep certain links in some places, like [[Interesting datasets]] or [[Inspiration]] or [[Personal learning map]] (sometimes in [[Inbox]]), but I try to limit the places I'm keeping links (mainly constrained by the categories of links I can keep, instead of an endless list).
