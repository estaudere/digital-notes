Write to think.

It helps to get your thoughts on paper. Writing doesn't have to come after thinkingâ€”in fact, the opposite. I believe that in order to put your thoughts on paper well, more often than not, you should write before or during the thinking.

For me at least, if I am confused about a subject or don't know what steps to take, it's helpful to go back to the beginning and write what I *do* know. That way, I eventually write something that comes into my head as it occurs to me, and then I go back and perfect that thought until it fits with the rest of my mind map.

This is the same theory behind [[The Feynman Technique for developing insight]], which asks the learner to write down everything they can about a subject until they approach a concept they cannot explain. That's where the learner should spend the most time developing insight.
