# Atomicity means notes are densely packed and free flowing

I want to go back to the metaphor of an atom. It is already clear what the size of the atom is and how it relates to the specificity of the notes—and how to use this property to [[Use notes to become a better writer]]. But what about other properties of atoms, like its movement or interaction with other atoms?

Very loosely speaking, atoms are connected to other atoms. There is rarely an atom by itself, and atomic bonds constantly interacting is what makes up our world—in this case, our mental model or second brain. They are very densely connected, like the atoms that make up, say, a salt crystal.

This is also a useful metaphor to think about because not all atoms are the same. In fact, the significant differences between many of them *allow* for that type of interaction to occur. In the same vein, it is useful to view notes as free-forming, and that their significant differences—in structure, type, topic, content, etc.—is what allows for better linking (and therefore, deeper thinking).

I suppose the moral of the story is that this notes system can indeed be chaotic, and it will still contribute to the linking nature of the brain. Do not spend too much time trying to structure them or make them perfect.
