## Science is the connective tissue
While science for the sake of science has it's value, it is using science (and math) to solving problems in society that particularly appeals to me. This is the case with other fields of study that are interesting to me as well—political science, sociology, writing all are studied in order to both further understand how our society works and how we can use that to solve problems. I will even go so far as to say it is dangerous to assume that one can only study one route.

Doctors, for example, should extensively study sociology, or they risk seeing a one-sided view of the problem. Sociology and science ethics describe the prevalence of medical racism both in the doctor's office and in clinical trials and other medical studies that make it difficult to accurately treat people of color, especially Black and Indigenous women. 

Thus, I do not wish to study simply "science" or "math" but rather how they intersect with other fields of study that focus on society. It not only helps to understand each subject itself better, but also encourages the thinking of the *why*—why are you studying this subject?
