There are three steps to take once you've sufficiently looked at source material for any new concept in order to drastically improve your learning and building deep knowledge:

Here's a paper.

| a topic i have just learned |
| --- |
| an explanation of the idea, as if I were teaching it to someone else |
| where I stopped, because there are gaps in my knowledge |

Where you stopped is where you know you have to dive into a topic deeper. Break the topic into chunks to make this process easier.

### When the Feynman Technique is useful

- To indentify precisely the places you don't understand
- For ideas you don't understand at all, do a Feyman but have the source material open (like a "guided" Feynman)
- For procedures and formulas (you can break them into smaller pieces)
- If you can do a Feynman completely from scratch on your own, it's useful to check your understanding
