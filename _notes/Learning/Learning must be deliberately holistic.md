## As a student, we must be intentional in connecting subjects

Centuries ago, people used to only study "philosophy," where they would discuss wordly matters without subjects. Subjects came later, when everyone started to be educated because they needed jobs. Now, separate subjects are taught in a modular fashion, and while this may be useful when it comes to putting together a baseline curriculum for a population that needs to be successful in the workforce, it's not useful for drawing connections and *forming* knowledge.

Knowledge is inherently connection-based, both in the way humans think about it and understand it. And while connections to other fields of study are only briefly mentioned as we are taught (especially in class), as a student or learner you must purposefully and deliberately connect classes. Without doing so, you would be passively learning, which is fine, but if you want to accrue knowledge, then the human mind as a learner does best when we form connections across disciplines.

This also has the added benefit of deepening your understanding of subjects and developing ideas on your own. See: [[No subject exists in a vacuum]].
